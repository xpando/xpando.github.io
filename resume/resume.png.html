                            <p>Amazon automated advertising provides services to hundreds of marketing
                                teams across Amazon that enable experimentation and analysis of marketing
                                campaigns. Our system matches the best campaigns with each customer based
                                on many factors such as a campaign&#39;s historical performance, customer
                                behavior and ML models produced by Amazon&#39;s data science teams. My
                                responsiblities include prototyping, system design and reviews, code reviews,
                                implementation, operations and mentoring other SDEs. The majority of my
                                individual project work has been on email and mobile push metrics and reporting.
                                Here are some highlights from my time at Amazon so far:</p>
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designed event processing pipeline for ingesting, processing and sharing
                                event data with internal analytics teams.</li>
                            <li>Implemented streaming click/open analytics using AWS Kinesis and AWS Glue.
                                This project replaced the Oracle implementation and reduced the delay for
                                metric data availablity from 24-48hrs to 1-2 hours.</li>
                            <li>Implemented idempotency enforcement for email sending at scale ensuring
                                that no email is sent more than once.</li>
                            <li>Prototyped realtime click/open rate dashboard using ElasticSearch and
                                Kibana for a team hackathon.</li>

    </h3> <span class="tenure">2009-08 â€” 2016-08</span>
                        <p>
                            <p>Mary Kay manufactures and sells cosmetics through a global network of
                                independent beauty consultants. Having spent the majority of my career
                                at Mary Kay, I enjoyed working on a diverse set of products and services
                                that enabled the company grow into a truly global company with over $4billion
                                of anual wholesale volume. Here are some hilights of the things I worked
                                on most recently at Mary Kay:</p>
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Worked on replatforming marykay.com and marykayintouch.com on Sitecore
                                CMS. In this role I acted as the Sitecore architect. I provided prototypes
                                and code samples for the more difficult parts of the application and provided
                                technical guidance to the development staff and partners that were building
                                the solution. I also implemented the integration of Sitecore with Mary
                                Kay&#39;s product catalog system and built the search and faceted product
                                category pages.</li>
                            <li>Built the CI/CD deployment pipeline for the Sitecore projects. Prior to
                                the Sitecore projects these sites were built using Sharepoint and releases
                                would take as long as 6 hours to complete. Using my automated build and
                                deploy system these releases could be executed in minutes. Additionally,
                                developers could use the same deployment scripts on their local development
                                machines which reduced their environment setup time from days to minutes
                                compared to the Sharepoint development process.</li>
                            <li>Prototyped deploying Sitecore on Windows Server containers as a POC for
                                our operations group.</li>
                            <li>Led the design and implementation of a UX redesign for myCustomers. myCustomers
                                is a CRM tool that Mary Kay consultants use to manage their customer list
                                and orders placed online at marykay.com. I boostrapped the project using
                                KockoutJS and Bootstrap css. Working with BAs and Stakeholders in weekly
                                iterations I would get feedback and approval on UX using functional protoypes
                                built using KnockuotJS, Twitter Bootstrap and mocked backend services.
                                These prototypes were built directly in the project and the team and I
                                would complete the implementation once they UX was approved. We completed
                                the redesign in 2 months compared to the 15 month developemnt effort on
                                the previous version. My team received a CIO award for delivering the finished
                                product in record time and the positive feedback from our stake holders
                                and Mary Kay consultants.</li>
                            <li>I integrated ElasticSearch with myCustomers to provide the feceted customer
                                and order history searches. I was able to rapidly implement this feature
                                because of the async event based architecture of the backend services I
                                had previously built.</li>
                            <li>Led the technical design and implementation of the services for marykay.com
                                and its Personal Web Site program that allows Mary Kay consultants to sign
                                up for and sell Mary Kay products online. I used a domain driven design
                                approach and a CQRS/EventSourced architecture. I built out the intial code,
                                unit tests and build automation. As the project grew I provided mentoring
                                and code reviews for new team members.</li>
                            <li>The FrontOffice CRM sytem is a WPF application used internally by telepone
                                support. The web browser views in the application used an embedded IE control
                                that sometimes crashed the application. I implmented a new model that hosted
                                the web browser in another process similar to how Google Chrome works.
                                This reduced the impact of web view crashes and enabled the use of newer
                                versions of IE.</li>
                            <li>The FrontOffice CRM system also needed a realtime push notification system
                                to send state change notifications between all of the running instances.
                                I built a service and client API for this feature. The client API provided
                                a reactive programming model using .NET Rx extensions. The real challenge
                                that I solved was enabling the client to write message filters that were
                                applied on the server reducing network traffic.</li>
                            <li>Developed a Silverlight application that would display reporting data
                                from an OLAP cube overlaid on a map. Data would be displayed in regions,
                                states and zips depending on the zoom level. Allowed user to adjust coloring
                                and ranges for the quintiles.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Implemented the first version of marykayintouch.com, a content portal
                                used by Mary Kay sales consultants to access news and information from
                                Mary Kay corporate and to access many of the other suite of applications
                                provided by Mary Kay headquarters. Used asp 3.0, VB 6, Visual InterDev
                                and Sql Server. I also participated in the conversion of this project to
                                .NET in later years. After porting to .NET I integrated the Google search
                                appliance to provide a better search experience to the consultants.</li>
                            <li>Implemented core framework components shared by many of the .NET applications
                                including the online ordering site.</li>
                            <li>Implemented the mail order entry application. This application was particularly
                                challenging because it required quite a lot of keyboard interaction so
                                that the data entry people could quickly navigate the order sheets. It
                                was basically a SPA application developed in 2001-2002 using HTCs and the
                                WebService behavior HTC from Microsoft. One interesting aspect was I built
                                a DataSet in JavaScript so the client code was very similar to code that
                                manipulated the order on the server side.</li>
                            <li>Implemented a calendar application using ASP.NET WebForms. Included a
                                pluggable data provider model so that calendar events could be aggregated
                                from many data sources.</li>
                            <li>Implemented the myBusiness application. myBusiness is a reporting tool
                                that the Mary Kay sales force uses to see how their sales and recruiting
                                is doing. It also provides alerts when they are close to certain recruiting
                                or sales goals.</li>
